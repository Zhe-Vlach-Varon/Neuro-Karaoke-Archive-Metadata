# Neuro-Karaoke-Archive-Metadata

## To-Do List:
- [X] Make so that changing the json changes the drive;
- [ ] Make it automatic, requires some time;
- [ ] Make a decent readme;
- [ ] Add old suggestions as pull requests;
- [ ] Make so that the hjson file are automatically renamed to match the new data;
- [ ] Add proper logging;
- [ ] Add support for adding files, not only modifying.
- [ ] Maybe add search for discrepancies?
(i.e. changing "Supercell" to "supercell" checks if all other all instances of "Supercell" were changed as well)
